# Pair Programming Session

## Setup 

Dependency: npm https://nodejs.org/en/

## Get started
Create a webapp with Create React App
```
npx create-react-app todo-app
cd todo-app
npm start
```

Open the Code in a code editor of your choice. When you save changes to the source files the webapp should reload automatically. 

Build a basic todo app. Donâ€™t feel like we have to get through the requirements. It is better to do a few things well than to complete everything rushed. If a technology is new to you feel free to ask me questions or to google it. I would like to see how you learn not just what you know.

## Tasks
1. Display of list of todo items (you can start with hardcoded list)
1. Allow creating new todo items
1. Allow deleting of todo items
1. Do some css and layout work to make things look better
1. Make the list persist with localStorage
1. Make the data persistence code be async with a delay to simulate http calls
1. Give ToDo items status (New, In Progress, Done)
1. Create a ToDo item page that displays info about a single ToDo item
1. Add deep linking to the site so a url can navigate directly to a single ToDo item (I recommend ReactRouter)

Feel free to add unit testing at any point.
